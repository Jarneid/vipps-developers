Hi

Vipps has a test environment called Merchant Test, or "MT" in short:
https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-test-environment.md

Vipps also have test apps for iOS (in TestFlight) and Android, which are
identical to the normal Vipps app, except that they have a different logo
and is connected to MT instead of the production environment. Details here:
