Hi

We are going to sort this out, but we need a little more information:

Environment: Is this in test (MT) or production?

App: Is it iOS and / or Android, and which version (s)? We would very much like to know
if the error is on both iOS and Android, and ask you to test this.

How many people experience the error every day, roughly?

Video: Is it possible to reproduce and give us a video from start to finish
the whole course of events and what happens after an unexpected mistake?

Description and screenshot: If video is not possible, we would like one
description of what happens, from start to finish - with screenshots.

To make it easier to understand what is happening: Here are some names of what is shown in Vipps:

- Login screen: Where you enter a PIN or do finger / face recognition.

- Load screen: Where three dots are displayed dancing while we collect the payment,
  we occasionally display errors on this screen. It is also relevant to know about this
  came right after logging in, or after viewing the home screen

- Home screen: Menu tab for friend payments.

- Payments screen: Menu tab for list of payments and bills and fixed appointments, etc.

- Payment screen: shows details of the payment, amount, allows the choice of card,
  add cards. Here we have many conditions, it is useful to know in detail what
  the user did here from start to finish.

- Webview: Displays the 3D Secure or BankID website.
