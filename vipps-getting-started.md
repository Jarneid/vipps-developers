## Get credentials

The fastest way to get a Vipps developer account for the test and production
environments, is to apply for a product at [vipps.no](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/).
If you have questions about your customer relationship, please
[contact customer service](https://www.vipps.no/kontakt-oss/bedrift/).

**Please note:** You will need a Norwegian organization number to apply for Vipps services.

Test credentials are normally available 24 hours after we receive the application.
When the application has been processed you will receive an email, and the
API keys can be retrieved by logging in to
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no)
with BankID. This normally takes a few days.

**Please note:** If you plan to use Vipps through a Partner or a PSP, you will have to
order the appropriate Vipps solution, and then contact the Partner or PSP
to have _them_ help you with developer access.

## Getting the API keys

Please note that API keys are _not_ available for
[Vippsnummer](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-i-butikk/ta-betalt-med-vipps/).
You may need to order
[Vipps På Nett](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/ta-betalt-paa-nett/ta-betalt-paa-nett/),
[Vipps Faste Betalinger](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/faste-betalinger/faste-betalinger/)
or
[Vipps Logg Inn](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/logg-inn-med-vipps/logg-inn-med-vipps/).
See
[Vipps products](https://vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/)
for an overview of all Vipps products, and
also the
[Vipps plugins](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers#plugins).

API keys are available in the Vipps portal:
The merchant's administrator can log in with BankID at
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no)
and retrieve the API keys under the `Utvikler` menu item.

All Vipps customers must have a Norwegian organization number, and the customer
agreements are signed with BankID. Since [portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no)
gives access to API keys for both the test and production environment, we require
BankID for logging in.
The customer's administrator can create additional users on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no).

If you do not have BankID, you will need the administrator to log in and provide
the API keys to you.

**Please note:** Vipps can not provide API keys in any other way, such as by
email, as the API keys give access to transferring money.
Vipps will never ask for your API keys, and you should keep them secret.

### API key details

| Name                     | Format | Example                              |  Description                     |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `client_id`              | GUID   | fb492b5e-7907-4d83-bc20-c7fb60ca35de | Client ID for the merchant (the "username")     |
| `client_secret`          | Base64 | Y8Kteew6GE3ZmeycEt6egg==             | Client Secret for the merchant (the "password") |
| `Vipps-Subscription-Key` | Base64 | 0f14ebcab0eb4b29ae0cb90d91b4a84a     | Subscription key for the product |

There are both a primary and secondary `Vipps-Subscription-Key`.
The primary and secondary keys are interchangeable; you can use either one,
they both work in the same way. Having two active keys enables you to
regenerate one subscription key, while still using the other key, without downtime.

**Please note:** `Vipps-Subscription-Key` was previously called `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`.
The legacy name `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` _must still be used in requests and code_,
but we are working to make `Vipps-Subscription-Key` work ASAP.

## API keys for different use

The same API keys are used for many types of integration:
Direct integration,
native apps for iOS and Android,
point of sale integrations,
[WooCommerce](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-woocommerce),
[Magento](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-magento) (both 1 and 2),
[Episerver](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-episerver),
[Shopify](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-shopify),
[Drupal](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-drupal),
[other plugins](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers#plugins)
and any other solution based on the Vipps eCom API.

# API products

An _API product_ is a "package" consisting of one or more APIs.

Vipps has previously had separate API keys for each API product, and a set of
API keys were directly linked to one sale unit. This meant that customers
needed to keep track of multiple API keys, and that access to a new API
required a new sale unit.

This is no longer the case: New customers now get the `Vipps-API` API product.

The Vipps-API API product give access to all current APIs, and the API keys for
the Vipps eCom v1 and v2 APIs have been “upgraded” to include the same APIs as
Vipps API.

## Vipps-API

This API product includes the following APIs:

| API          | Description                           | Documentation                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Access Token | Required to obtain a JWT              | See: [Get an access token](#get-an-access-token) |
| eCom v2      | eCommerce, including express checkout | https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api        |
| Recurring    | Recurring API                         | https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-recurring-api   |
| Vipps Log In | Identification                        | https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-login-api       |

Vipps-API also includes some _legacy_ APIs:

| API              | Description                                                      | Documentation                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| eCom v1          | eCommerce, legacy version, to be phased out on September 1 2020. | https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api-v1     |
| Signup and Login | Legacy API (superseded by Vipps Log In), end of life Dec 31 2019 | https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-signuplogin-api |

See more details about the
[phase-out of eCom API v1](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/v1-deprecation.md)
on September 1 2020.

If you are still using a legacy API, you should upgrade as soon as possible.
The best way to keep up to date of changes is to
[star the API repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-stars).

## Legacy API products

Old API products have the `ZZZ` prefix to make them easy to distinguish,
and to always sort them at the bottom of lists.
One example is `ZZZ eCommerce-Classic-Services-API`.

The legacy API products prefixed with `ZZZ` have been updated to also include the
current, corresponding APIs in Vipps-API.
This means that a sale unit that could previously only use eCom v1,
can now also use eCom v2, with the same API keys as before.

The legacy API products still work, and there is no need to "upgrade" to Vipps-API,
unless there are technical problems.

The current APIs offer substantial improvements over the legacy APIs, and
we strongly recommend upgrading to the current version as soon as possible.

# Quick overview of how to make an API call

## Get an access token

All Vipps API requests must include an `Authorization` header with
a JSON Web Token (JWT), which we call the _access token_.
The access token is obtained by calling
[`POST:/accesstoken/get`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Authorization_Service/fetchAuthorizationTokenUsingPost)
and passing the `client_id`, `client_secret` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`.
(We _are_ aware that this is a `POST`, without a body, to an endpoint with
`get` in the URL, and hope to fix it in a later version of the API. Sorry.)

Request (including the optional `Vipps-*` HTTP headers):

```http
POST https://apitest.vipps.no/accesstoken/get
client_id: fb492b5e-7907-4d83-ba20-c7fb60ca35de
client_secret: Y8Kteew6GE2ZmeycEt6egg==
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 0f14ebcab0ec4b29ae0cb90d91b4a84a
Vipps-System-Name: Acme Enterprises Ecommerce DeLuxe
Vipps-System-Version: 3.1.2
Vipps-System-Plugin-Name: Point Of Sale Excellence
Vipps-System-Plugin-Version 4.5.6
```

The `client_id`, `client_secret` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`are unique per
`merchantSerialNumber` (MSN, i.e. the number of the sale unit) and can be found on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no).

| Header Name | Header Value | Description |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `client_id` | A GUID value | Client ID for the sale unit |
| `client_secret` | Base 64 encoded string | Client Secret for the sale unit |
| `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` | Base 64 encoded string | Subscription key for the product |

Response:

```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "86398",
  "ext_expires_in": "0",
  "expires_on": "1495271273",
  "not_before": "1495184574",
  "resource": "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni <snip>"
}
```

An explanation of the contents of the access token (the JWT properties):

| Name                        | Description                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Bearer`                    | It’s a `Bearer` token. The word `Bearer` should be added before the token |
| `expires_in`                | Token expiry duration in seconds. |
| `ext_expires_in`            | Extra expiry time. Not used. |
| `expires_on`                | Token expiry time in epoch time format. |
| `not_before`                | Token creation time in epoch time format. |
| `resource`                  | For the product for which token has been issued. |
| `access_token`              | The actual access token that needs to be used in `Authorization` request header. |

**Please note:** The access token is valid for 1 hour in the test environment
and 24 hours in the production environment. To be sure that you are using
correct time please use `expires_in` or `expires_on`.

This is an example of an error caused by mixing the API keys for test and
production (formatted for readability):

```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized_client",
  "error_description":
    "AADSTS70001: Application with identifier 'e9b6c99d-2442-4a5d-84a2-\
     c53a807fe0c4' was not found in the directory testapivipps.no\
     Trace ID: 3bc2b2a0-d9bb-4c2e-8367- 5633866f1300\r\nCorrelation ID:\
     bb2f4093-70af-446a-a26d-ed8becca1a1a\r\nTimestamp: 2017-05-19 09:21:28Z",
  "error_codes": [ 70001 ],
  "timestamp": "2017-05-19 09:21:28Z",
  "trace_id": "3bc2b2a0-d9bb-4c2e-8367-5633866f1300",
  "correlation_id": "bb2f4093-70af-446a-a26d-ed8becca1a1a"
}
```

After obtaining the access token (JWT), it is then used for the "real" calls
to the API, with the `Bearer` keyword (an example with the optional
`Vipps-*` HTTP headers):

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni <snip>
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: 0f14ebcab0ec4b29ae0cb90d91b4a84a
Vipps-System-Name: Acme Enterprises Ecommerce DeLuxe
Vipps-System-Version: 3.1.2
Vipps-System-Plugin-Name: Point Of Sale Excellence
Vipps-System-Plugin-Version: 4.5.6
```

For more details: See the OpenAPI specifications and Postman collections
for the APIs.

### HTTP response codes

This API returns the following HTTP statuses in the responses:

| HTTP status        | Description                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`           | Request successful.                                     |
| `400 Bad Request`  | Invalid request, see the `error` for details.           |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Invalid authorization.                                  |
| `403 Forbidden`    | Authentication ok, but credentials lacks authorization. |
| `500 Server Error` | An internal Vipps problem.                              |

**Please note:** `Vipps-Subscription-Key` was previously called `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`. The legacy name `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` must still be used in request headers. We will at some point phase out the old name completely, but it is not trivial and will take some time.
