## Recurring API v3

The
[Vipps Recurring API v3](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/)
adds new functionality for three new types of
campaigns (like "10 weeks for 10 kr"), and several other improvements.

## Solutions

The new
[Solutions](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/vipps-solutions)
section of our developer documentation describes best practice for
combining Vipps APIs for specific use cases, like:
* Loyalty at the point of sale (POS)
* Electric vehicle charging
* Parking

## Updated emails to new merchants (and partners)

We have updated and improved all emails sent as part of becoming a Vipps
merchant (the onboarding process). They all use the Vipps design, and
contain:
* The merchant's organization number
* The merchant's name
* The sale unit's MSN
* The sale unit's name

## Reminders

### Please check your API calls for errors

We are working on eliminating incorrect API use. Please:

* Monitor the responses you get when making API calls
* Log all errors
* Fix errors as quickly as possible
* Use the
  [API Dashboard](../developer-resources/api-dashboard.md)
  to find problems with your integration.
