## Recurring API v3

The
[Vipps Recurring API v3](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/)
adds new functionality for three new types of
campaigns (like "10 weeks for 10 kr"), and several other improvements.

## Something something

But what?

## Reminders

### Please check your API calls for errors

We are working on eliminating incorrect API use. Please:

* Monitor the responses you get when making API calls
* Log all errors
* Fix errors as quickly as possible
* Use the
  [API Dashboard](../developer-resources/api-dashboard.md)
  to find problems with your integration.
