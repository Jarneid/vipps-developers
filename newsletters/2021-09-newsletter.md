# The Vipps QR API

An early version of the Vipps QR API is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-qr-api

The Vipps QR API lets merchants generate Vipps QR codes that can be used to pay
over the counter, without requiring the Vipps user to provide their telephone
number to the merchant.

The QR code, when scanned and opened, will redirect the user to the Vipps
landing page, which on the phone will automatically trigger a switch to the
Vipps app where they can pay the merchant.

# The Vipps Order Management API

An early version of the Vipps Order Management API is available on GitHub:
https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-order-management-api/

The Order Management API allows merchants to send rich receipt information to
existing Vipps transaction. This information is shown to the customer in the
app in their order history. This functionality is available for both recurring
and direct payments, but not for passthrough payments.

# The Vipps Merchant Management API
