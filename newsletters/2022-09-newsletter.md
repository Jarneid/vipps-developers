# New developer documentation

We have a completely new, in-progress, website for all developer documentation:
[https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/)

# Inform customers that there are no fees when paying with Vipps

It can help your conversion if you remind your users that:
* There are no Vipps fees when paying a business
* Users get all the benefits of the card when using the card in Vipps (bonus points, etc)

We recommend using this text where users select payment method:
"Husk: Vipps er alltid gebyrfritt nÃ¥r du betaler til bedrifter."

If you use Klarna Checkout, we have some tips
[here](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api-faq.md#can-i-use-vipps-with-klarna-checkout).

# Vipps on-site messaging

[Vipps on-site-messaging](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-checkout-api/blob/main/vipps-checkout-on-site-messaging.md)
contains a badges in different variants that can be used to let your customers
know that Vipps payment is accepted.

# Partner API: Pre-fill applications

Partners can now use the
[Partner API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner-api)
to pre-fill applications and
[submit a product order for a merchant](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner-api/blob/main/vipps-partner-api.md#submit-a-product-order-for-a-merchant).

# Reminders

## Please check your API calls for errors

We are working on eliminating incorrect API use. Although we always respond to
incorrect API calls with a sensible HTTP status (usually `HTTP 400 Bad Request`)
and an informative error message in the response body, we see that some merchants
and partners keep making incorrect API calls.

Please:
- Monitor the responses you get when making API calls
- Log all errors
- Fix errors as quickly as possible
- Use the API Dashboard
- Contact us if there is anything we can help with

## Use the API Dashboard to find problems with your integration

The
[API Dashboard](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers#api-dashboard)
is available to all merchants for both the production and test environments,
and is an easy way to see if you are using the Vipps APIs correctly.
Think of it as a "health check", that you can use to see if there are any
problems you need to investigate.

Here's an example for the Vipps eCom API's `/refund` endpoint:
