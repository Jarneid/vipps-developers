# New developer documentation

We have a completely new, in-progress, website for all developer documentation:
[https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/)

# Inform customers that there are no fees when paying with Vipps

It can help conversion to remind users that:
* There are no Vipps fees when paying a business
* Users get all the benefits of the card when using the card in Vipps (bonus points, etc)

We recommend using this text where users select payment method:
"Husk: Vipps er alltid gebyrfritt nÃ¥r du betaler til bedrifter."

If you use Klarna Checkout, we have some tips
[here](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api-faq.md#can-i-use-vipps-with-klarna-checkout).

# Vipps on-site messaging

[Vipps on-site-messaging](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-checkout-api/blob/main/vipps-checkout-on-site-messaging.md)
contains a badges in different variants that can be used to let your customers
know that Vipps payment is accepted.

# Partner API: Pre-fill applications

Partners can now use the
[Partner API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner-api)
to pre-fill applications and
[submit a product order for a merchant](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-partner-api/blob/main/vipps-partner-api.md#submit-a-product-order-for-a-merchant).

# Reminders

## Please check your eCom API calls for errors

We are working on eliminating incorrect API use. Although we always respond to
incorrect API calls with a sensible HTTP status (usually `HTTP 400 Bad Request`)
and an informative error message in the response body, we see that some merchant
and partners keep making incorrect API calls.

Please:
- Monitor the responses you get when making API calls
- Log all errors
- Fix errors as quickly as possible
- Use the API Dashboard
- Contact us if there is anything we can help with

One example: Far too many calls to
[`POST:/ecomm/v2/payments`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-ecom-api/#/Vipps_eCom_API/initiatePaymentV3UsingPOST)
use an incorrectly formatted phone number.
The effect is that the user's phone number is not correctly pre-filled on
the Vipps landing page.
Please make sure you send the `mobileNumber` in `91234567` format, not
`+47 91 23 45 67` or something else.
We have previously tried to respond with `HTTP 400 Bad Request` (as we should)
for incorrectly formatted phone numbers, but that broke _a lot_  of integrations,
so we decided to accept the incorrect API calls even though they give a poor
user experience.

See:
* [Use the API Dashboard to find problems with your integration](#use-the-api-dashboard-to-find-problems-with-your-integration)
* "Common errors" in the
  [eCom API FAQ](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api/blob/master/vipps-ecom-api-faq.md)

## Use the API Dashboard to find problems with your integration

The API Dashboard is available to all merchants for both the production and test environments,
and is an easy way to see if you are using the Vipps APIs correctly.
Think of it as a "health check", that you can use to see if there are any
problems you need to investigate.

See it on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no)
under the "Utvikler" ("Developer") tab.
Here's an example for the Vipps eCom API's `/refund` endpoint:
